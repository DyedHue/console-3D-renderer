Include 3D models here (Only obj files are supported)

How to use :
first type m. Then after a space, the name of the file(including ".obj "), after a space, type the x, y and z coordinates(positive z is up) of your desired position to place the model at, all separated by space. After another space, type the scale of the object(1 means original size), after another space, type a character(8 bit) which is going to be the character that will be used to show the model when it's visible on the screen.
You can include 1 model in one line. Any line works.

For example : "m MyModel.obj 0 3.5 2.89 2 #" (without the strings) is going to place an object in(x, y, z) = (0, 3.5, 2.89) with 2 times its original size and it's going to show up with the character '#' when running.
